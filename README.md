HOWTO
=====

I frequently recompile stuff.  This tool makes it easy by recording the compilation steps and options into a script file.  Just go into your source directory and:

	$ howto -e	<--- Uses $EDITOR to alter the script
	$ howto		<--- Recompile the same way as the last time

That's about it.
